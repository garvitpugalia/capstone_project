Capstone Project - Building a self-supervised framework for training lighting accurate diffusion models

Abstract
In this project, we propose a self-supervised learning framework aimed at enhancing the accuracy of lighting and shadowing in image synthesis using diffusion models. The framework is composed of four components that can be combined to create the self-supervised pipeline. We first design and experiment with pre-trained models capable of generating high-fidelity depth maps from 2D images, which can be used to back-project the image to a 3D space. We then experiment with different pipelines (such as OpenGL and Blender) that project 2D images into 3D spaces and allow the user to manipulate light sources to generate shadows under different lighting conditions. Lastly, we develop and train a tiny stable diffusion model that leverages the generated depth maps and user-specified light source locations to produce images with accurate lighting. As an additional datapoint, we experiment with shadow detection models that can provide supervision to the diffusion model. These components can be combined to generate ground-truth lighting accurate images for self-supervised training of the diffusion model. Unsuccessful attempts have also been recorded for further inspection and development.
